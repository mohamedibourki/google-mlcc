# 🧠 Introduction to Machine Learning (Google ML Crash Course)

## 📌 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a method of teaching software (called a *model*) to make predictions or generate content based on data.  
Rather than writing rules, we train a model to *learn patterns* in data.

## 🚀 How ML Works

Instead of manually coding behavior (like weather forecasting with physics), ML trains a model with massive datasets.  
Once trained, the model can make predictions or generate content (text, images, video, etc.).

## 📚 Types of ML Systems

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- Learns from **labeled data** (input + correct output)
- Like learning from past exams
- Two common tasks:
  - **Regression**: Predicts numeric values  
    - e.g. Predict house price, ride duration
  - **Classification**: Predicts categories  
    - e.g. Spam detection, image contains a cat

| Type         | Example Use Case                   | Output                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Regression   | Predict house price                | A number (e.g., $250,000)     |
| Classification | Detect if image contains a dog   | Category (e.g., Yes/No)       |

---

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- Learns from **unlabeled data**
- Finds **patterns or clusters**
- Example: Clustering weather data to identify seasons

> 🌀 No answers given — the model finds structure on its own.

---

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
- Learns through **trial and error**
- Receives **rewards or penalties** for actions
- Used in:
  - Training robots to walk
  - Teaching software to play games (e.g. AlphaGo)

---

### 4. **Generative AI**
- **Creates new content** from user input
- Can handle multiple input/output types:
  - `Text → Text` (e.g., explain a topic)
  - `Text → Image` (e.g., draw an octopus in space)
  - `Text → Code` (e.g., generate a Python loop)
  - `Image → Text` (e.g., describe a photo)

#### Example Table:

| Input Type    | Output Type | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Text          | Text        | Article summary |
| Text          | Image       | AI-generated drawing |
| Text          | Code        | Python function |
| Image         | Text        | Photo description |

## ⚙️ How Generative AI Works

- Initially trained with **unsupervised learning** to mimic patterns
- Refined with **supervised or reinforcement learning** for task-specific skills
- Like:
  - A comedian mimicking a style
  - A band covering another band’s songs
